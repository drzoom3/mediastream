# Small HTML page that uses Vue for reactivity.

The page should have a button called "Join" that when clicked "navigates" (without doing any network request) to call and on the resulting page shows a canvas element which shall show a video from the device's camera. The user should be able to turn the camera on/off via a button.

Under that, a list of comments shall be fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments via Ajax and displayed.
